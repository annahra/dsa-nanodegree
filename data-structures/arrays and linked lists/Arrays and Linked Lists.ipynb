    "* If you were to look under the hood, you would find that a **Python list is essentially implemented like an array** (specifically, it behaves like a *dynamic array*, if you're curious). In particular, **the elements of a Python list are contiguous in memory, and they can be accessed using an index.**\n",
    "* In addition to the underlying array, a Python list also includes some additional behavior. For example, you can use things like pop and append methods on a Python list to add or remove items. **Using those methods, you can essentially utilize a Python list like a stack** (which is another type of data structure we'll discuss shortly)."
